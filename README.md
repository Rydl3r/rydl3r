Building the web, one pixel at a time ðŸš€

I'm Ivan, a frontend developer who's spent the last 4+ years turning coffee into code and ideas into interactive experiences. Currently crafting digital solutions at GlobalLogic, where I get to work on projects that actually matter.

What I bring to the table:

â€¢ 4 years of hardcore React development (with TypeScript, because life's too short for runtime errors)

â€¢ Experience scaling from scrappy freelance projects to enterprise-level platforms

â€¢ A knack for making complex systems actually user-friendly and intuitive

â€¢ The ability to collaborate seamlessly with designers, backend devs, and product teams

My tech playground: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Redux, GraphQL, MUI, Tailwind, and whatever new framework the JavaScript gods decide to bless us with next week.

From my freelance days to building international platforms, I've learned that great frontend development isn't just about making things look pretty - it's about creating experiences that users actually want to use.

Always up for connecting with fellow developers, discussing the latest in frontend tech, or debating whether CSS-in-JS is the future or just a phase we're going through.

Let's build something awesome together!
